I'm back with another project. I am using the command line to capture packets. This is kind of an addition to first lab I did but I am doing more and starting over from scratch

So what I did first is go to the command line and use dumpcap to capture packets on my wi-fi network. I messed up the first time but the second time I captured packets and wrote the file to my desktop. Once I got the packets, I opened the file.

From there I created a button that only showed 75.75.75.75 (nba.com) and then I changed the color so it will easily stand out.
